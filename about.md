Hello! My name's Sal and I'm currently a student at the University of Florida studying computer science. I'm an open source developer who's dabbled in many different fields, including DevOps, video game modding, and software engineering. 

I'm also a Top Writer on Medium where I frequently create articles on various computer science topics. In my free time, I play video games and practice fencing.
